Calculation of Tesla ($TSLA) volatility over a 5 year period.

For a course on Financial Derivatives and Investment Markets, I pulled stock price data for $TSLA directly from Yahoo Finance and calculated the volatility of the stock over a 5 year period. The ability to do this gives investors insight as to how much volatility their investment portfolios can withstand in order to maintain a healthily balanced portfolio of investment instruments.
